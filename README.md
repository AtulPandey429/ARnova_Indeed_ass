Getting Started
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

Node.js and npm installed on your local machine.
A backend server with API endpoints for user login, saving messages, and fetching previous login data.
Basic knowledge of React.js.
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-app-name.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd your-app-name
Install the project dependencies:

Usage
Start the development server:

bash

Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:3000.

You can log in with your credentials or use the special credentials for the "admin" user:

Username: admin
Email: admin@admin.com
Mobile Number: 0000000000
After logging in, you can leave messages, and for the "admin" user, a table containing previous login data will be displayed.

Features

Message submission and display.
Display of previous login data for "admin" users.
Responsive and user-friendly interface.
API Endpoints
The application relies on the following backend API endpoints:

/api/user/login: Handles user login.
/api/user/save-message: Saves user messages.
/api/user/previous-logins: Fetches previous login data.
Ensure your backend server provides these endpoints and returns data in the required format.
